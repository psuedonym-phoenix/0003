## Shift Cipher Demo

This repository now includes a browser-based page (`index.php`) for encoding or decoding text with a custom shift cipher. The interface features a dark theme with live transform, encrypt/decrypt buttons, swap/copy/clear controls and keyboard shortcuts.

### Run locally

```
php -S localhost:8000
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/index.php` in your browser to try the cipher.
