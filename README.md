P2P - Chat Encrypt pear to pear

## Shift Cipher Demo

This repository now includes a simple PHP page (`index.php`) that can encode or decode text using a custom shift cipher. All vowels rotate to the next vowel and consonants advance to the next consonant.

To run locally:

```
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000/index.php` in your browser to try the cipher.
